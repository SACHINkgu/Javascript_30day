# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
- **Task 1**: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
- **Task 2**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
- **Task 3**: Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
- **Task 4**: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
- **Task 5**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`
- **Task 6**: Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## Feature Requests:

1. **Variable Types Console Log**: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
2. **Reassignment Demo**: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

# Day 2: Operators

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
- **Task 1**: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 3**: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 4**: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 5**: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Assignment Operators
- **Task 6**: Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- **Task 7**: Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Comparison Operators
- **Task 8**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
- **Task 9**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
- **Task 10**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

### Activity 4: Logical Operators
- **Task 11**: Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 12**: Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 13**: Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Ternary Operator
- **Task 14**: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
